# Fusion Master Graduation Project â€” IDS Plotting & Analysis Scripts and Simulation results

## About
This repository contains Python scripts I created during my Fusion Master Graduation project on the **ITER Pulse Design Simulator**.  
They are aimed at **IDS data visualisation, data analysis, and IDS manipulation**.

These scripts are **not perfectly optimised**, but they worked for me as a solid starting point.  
Perhaps some of them can be useful for you to learn from or expand upon.

It also contains simulation data from testing the NICE inverse + TORAX coupling scheme. In each test case a corresponding text file contains the most relevant information/settings of that simulation + the MUSCLE3 manager file also contains simulation info and logs.

You can copy, modify, and use these scripts for any purpose, without attribution.

## Disclaimer
These scripts were created for my own project needs and may require adjustments for other use cases.
